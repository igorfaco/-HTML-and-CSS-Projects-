		<h3> The Importance of Pets in Our Lives </h3>
		<p> We’ve all heard people who say that pets are “just” animals, as though somehow they’re not important in our lives. These people have likely never owned a loyal dog or loving cat and their words couldn’t be further from the truth. Most pet owners will know how wonderful owning an animal can be; they will understand the companionship and how beautiful bonds can be formed between animal and human.

The benefits to owning a pet are endless. </p>
